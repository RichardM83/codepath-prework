## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite apps and features:
- Youtube
    - Search feature
    - Comment Sections
- Apple Maps
    - Easy input of start/end sections
    - path finding algorithm
- Google Calendar 
    - Selecting time blocks
    - Adding descriptions to events

App idea I would like to build:
- UMD Room Finding App: UMD app that allows students to find an efficient path from one room to another. It can be optimized further to find a path from a room to the nearest fire exit and other common rooms, such as bathrooms and stairways. Additionally, I would want a way for the student to select the building they are in.

## Notes

- Difficulties adjusting to new software
- Difficulties formatting labels and buttom for user
